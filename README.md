# PySoy-Dungeon-Designer
PySoy Dungeon Designer is a GUI app that can be used to design dungeon scenes
in PySoy game engine. Visit http://www.pysoy.org/ to get PySoy.

To run the Dungeon Designer, simply run dungeon_designer.py with python 3.

I developed this as a part of Google Summer of Code 2015. The GSoC project involved other things in addition to this. Take a look at shivoammalhotra.blogspot.in to find out more.
